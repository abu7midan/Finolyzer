FinOps for Non-Cloud IT Systems — Introducing Finolyzer

Introduction
In today's world, much attention is given to cloud-native cost optimization.
But what about the organizations still running core systems outside the cloud? On premises or hybrid ?
Non-cloud infrastructure — like servers, integrations, on-prem services, and shared resources — represents a major chunk of IT spend , often unmanaged and invisible.
These costs are real , recurring, and significant… yet not tracked same like billing module inside google or Microsoft .
In this blog post, I will explain real case about FinOps for non-cloud environments.
And this is exactly what Finolyzer was built for.
What is FinOps?
FinOps is a framework that brings together finance, engineering, and operations to manage the economic lifecycle of IT systems.
While traditionally focused on the cloud, FinOps actually applies to any IT stack , including:
•	servers 
•	Shared networks, infra, licensing 
•	API-based integrations 
•	Support staff & resource allocation
At its core, FinOps is about making clear:
What is each system costing us to run , and is it worth the value?
Some time operation cost is more costly than building system.

Finolyzer is a FinOps platform that helps IT leaders & finance teams manage the true cost of applications, servers, APIs, and human resources. With system-level granularity, you can visualize dependencies, identify high-cost areas, calculate shared service expenses, and track usage-based integrations—all in real time.
Finolyzer is a modern, open-source FinOps platform designed specifically for non-cloud IT systems , including:
•	On-premise systems
•	Shared service environments 
•	infrastructure (servers + cloud)
•	internal integrations
•	Etc.
It offers a powerful way to:
•	Track actual and projected operational spend
•	Allocate shared costs across systems
•	Calculate cost-per-portfolio or system or provider component down to daily/monthly/yearly
•	Visualize cost flows via dashboards and reports 
•	Add budget and alert and error budget.
•	Easy to integrate with any system 
•	Api based 
•	Able to customize 
•	
System Architecture
Key Entities
•	Portfolio
A group of application systems (e.g. HR apps)
•	ApplicationSystem
A single system to be cost-tracked
•	SystemDependency
Servers, Integrations, Resources, etc. tied to the system
•	SharedService
Shared components (e.g. internet, rent, backup)
•	IntegrationService
Trackable API/service with cost-per-call
•	Resource
Human operational cost (support, admin, ops)
•	CostSummaryRequest
Output: cost breakdown per quarter/month/year
